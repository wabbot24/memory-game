import Data from "../Data.json"
// have this data in the state function
import React from "react"
import Component from "react"

import Navbar from "./navbar"

// import images from ./image-components/all-the-images

// send props to navbar, which then sends props to click-result

// use componentDidMount() to do the setState() that shuffles all the images
//   - this is attached to the class syntax and does not need to be called

// onclick event will set state

//i'm changing this to see if that makes a difference
